# EECS_6322
This is the official repo for EECS 6322 Reproducibility project

Hello. The main github contains all of the important (and small!!!) files that are, in essence, required for this project to run. Below, we will be giving the link to the datasets that were used (since that is waaay too big for a Github repo) and also the generated log files (if you wish to check them out).
